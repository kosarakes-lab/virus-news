                BREAKING IMAGE: low-resolution panic.
                A screenshot circulates before the event happened
                and what it depicts even settles into reality.
                Compression artifacts become evidence.
                Blurriness becomes truth.
                The spectacle arrives first as noise, 
                then as narrative, then as habit.
            </div>
            <div class="poem">
                Scroll.
                A feed arranged like a corridor with no exits: 
                thumbnail-size tragedies, recycled layouts, cloned
                headlines, faces cropped too close, colors overcooked, 
                a visual language engineered to overwhelm.
                The eye never rests; the mind grows tired; the body stays still.
                In Bulgaria, media capture is not abstract. 
                it is visible, daily, spatial.
                Poor-quality images carry the weight of national moods.
                Corruption appears not as story but as aesthetic: 
                glitch, repetition, echo.
            </div>
            <div class="poem">
                Click.
                Here are gathered the fragments: 
                propaganda websites growing from low-budget templates, 
                overexposed crime photos, screenshots on Facebook groups, 
                comments stacked like sediment, and the silence between
                them the silence of isolation disguised as information.
                Each image collected here is not decoration but data:
                evidence of how control becomes perceptual,
                how manipulation hides in the mundane,
                how spectacle erodes reality until only reaction remains.
                These visuals perform it.
            </div>
            <div class="poem">
                This is therefore not a proposal of polished ideas 
                but a map of atmospheres:
                the heaviness of scrolling without end,
                the claustrophobia of identical layouts,
                the strange comfort of low fidelity,
                the exhaustion produced by endless urgency.
                Through these images,
                I trace the ecology of a system 
                that keeps the viewer alone, 
                overstimulated yet underinformed, 
                exposed yet powerless.
                A system that governs not through violence,
                but through the quiet, accumulating pressure of spectacle.
                Here, I begin to design inside the collapse:
                where the pixel becomes political,
                where the blur is a symptom,
                where the poor image reveals 
                more than the pristine one ever could.
                A place where isolation is produced at scale
                and where its visual logic can finally be made visible.
