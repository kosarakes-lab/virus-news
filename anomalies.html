        <p class="intro">
          Not all news websites behave as one might expect. In this section, I explore the strange, absurd, and
          sometimes humorous errors that appear across the platforms studied. This is what I call their “anomalies.”
          These glitches are not just technical failures; they reveal the low-quality, low-effort nature of production
          and highlight how these sites prioritize spectacle over detail.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 1 -->
        <h2>
          Misplaced Clicks: Facebook Code in the Article Excerpt
        </h2>

        <p>
          On several websites, the line between content and tracking collapses in amusing ways. Moderators or site
          editors have inserted Facebook click-tracking scripts directly into the section meant for the article excerpt.
          Instead of a concise summary of the article, visitors encounter invisible tracking machinery disguised as
          content.
        </p>
        <P>
          This error is both literal and metaphorical: the content becomes indistinguishable from the systems that
          monitor its reception. In the context of this research, it highlights how low-quality production turns news
          into spectacle where form, function, and interface collide, and attention is captured more for clicks and
          metrics than for meaning.
        </P>

        <h2>
          Placeholder Chaos: Lorem Ipsum and English in Bulgarian Platforms
        </h2>

        <p>
          Some websites retain placeholder text that was clearly never replaced, leaving English filler where Bulgarian
          content should appear. Contact forms, article excerpts, and other sections still display generic corporate
          jargon, revealing that the site was never fully finished or carefully edited.
        </p>

        <figure class="blog-image">

        </figure>
        <p>
          This anomaly underscores the low-effort, template-driven production of these platforms. Even as they attempt
          to present themselves as active news sources, their unfinished or mismatched text exposes the performative
          nature of the content. In line with the spectacle framework, these sites are less about conveying meaningful
          information and more about creating the appearance of activity and attention is captured through volume and
          repetition, not through accuracy or polish.

        <h2>Paid Comments: Foreign-Language Bots on Bulgarian Articles</h2>

        <p>
          On some Bulgarian media websites, the comment sections are populated exclusively by bots posting in English or
          other foreign languages (never in Bulgarian). These automated responses appear under articles written in
          Bulgarian about domestic topics, creating a striking disconnect between content and engagement.

        </p>
        <p>
          This pattern strongly suggests the use of paid comment farms operating abroad, rather than genuine audience
          interaction. Within the spectacle framework, these foreign-language bots emphasize quantity over quality: they
          simulate activity, create the illusion of discussion, and reinforce the performative nature of the platform,
          while contributing nothing to meaningful local debate.

        <!-- Section 4 -->
        <h2>
          A Law That Sees Nothing
        </h2>

        <p>
          Introduced in 2018 (from Delyan Peevski, the media magnate and company), the so-called “Peevski law” requires
          media outlets to declare who controls their editorial policy, presenting itself as a tool for transparency. In
          reality, it relies entirely on self-declaration and offers no mechanism to verify whether the stated control
          reflects actual influence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Editorial power rarely operates in explicit or formal ways. It emerges through ownership structures, financial
          pressure, advertising flows, and synchronized publishing practices, none of which can be captured through a
          declaration form. Oversight is assigned to the Ministry of Culture, an institution that has openly stated it
          lacks the expertise and capacity to analyze media control or coordinated behavior.

        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, the law produces symbolic compliance rather than meaningful accountability. Small independent
          outlets face real risk from sanctions, while large, structurally coordinated media networks remain formally
          “transparent” without scrutiny. The anomaly lies not in a failure of enforcement, but in a system designed to
          simulate regulation while leaving existing power structures intact.
        </p>

        <h2>
          The Media Group That Is Not Media

        </h2>
        <p>
          Several of the analyzed websites claim in their footers to belong to a “media group” called Asmara, asserting
          collective ownership and shared copyright. However, official company records show that Asmara is registered
          for a broad range of commercial activities unrelated to journalism, including real estate, construction,
          tourism, retail, and consultancy, with no explicit mandate as a media organization. This discrepancy creates a
          structural opacity that complicates accountability and regulation. By presenting themselves as part of a media
          group without being legally defined as such, these outlets blur ownership lines, evade meaningful oversight,
          and exploit gaps in existing media regulation frameworks, including those established by the Peevski law and
          the Council for Electronic Media.

        <h2>From Selling News to Selling Pools: The Strange Fate of Disposed Websites</h2>

        <p>
          Some formerly active news platforms have vanished or transformed in unexpected ways. URLs that once hosted
          articles now return errors, offer the domain for sale, or redirect to entirely unrelated sites. The most
          striking example is news7.eu, whose main domain and subdomains now lead to a website promoting swimming pools
          in collaboration with a recognized brand
        </p>
        <p>
          The domain has been rebranded as desjoyaux.bg, operated by a recently registered company, Novax Group Ltd.,
          which reports no income, provides no precise physical address, and features stock images rather than original
          content. This transformation from active news outlet to pool promotion site underscores the disposable,
          transactional nature of these low-quality platforms. Even in their afterlife, they perform spectacle: a
          ghostly trace of attention, rebranded and repurposed, with little concern for coherence or authenticity.
