        <p class="intro">
          In an environment where news is recycled, blurred, and endlessly scrolled, information behaves more like a
          system than a story. This experiment does not seek to determine where information originates, but rather to
          examine how it behaves once released into a saturated media environment. By reconstructing the replication
          anatomy of repeated news articles across multiple outlets, the project approaches news content not as
          narrative, but as organism that mutates minimally, spreads efficiently, and prioritizes visibility over truth.

        </p>

        <!-- Section 1 -->
        <h2>Sources</h2>

        <p>
          The first step involved defining the corpus of news websites to be analyzed. The selection process followed
          two complementary paths.
        </p>
        <p>
          An initial group of websites was identified through direct observation of dissemination practices within
          Bulgarian Facebook news groups. In these spaces, specific troll-like accounts repeatedly circulated links from
          a small set of outlets (most notably novinite-dnes.eu and 24chasa.eu) which themselves frequently linked to or
          republished content originating from narod.bg. These websites formed the initial nucleus of the dataset.
        </p>
        <p>
          A second group of websites was identified through content similarity. Articles published on the initial sites
          were used as reference points to locate identical or near-identical texts appearing elsewhere. This process
          revealed a broader network of media outlets engaged in republishing the same narratives, ultimately resulting
          in a final corpus of 13 websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than aiming for representativeness of the Bulgarian media landscape as a whole, the selection
          deliberately focused on a tightly interconnected ecosystem in which content replication appeared systematic
          rather than incidental.

        </p>


        <!-- Section 2 -->
        <h2>Data collection</h2>

        <p>
          Dedicated scrapers were developed for each website to collect all articles published in 2025, restricted to
          sections related to politics and Bulgaria. Although section naming varied across platforms, this constraint
          ensured topical consistency while enabling comparison across structurally different websites.
        </p>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Each article page was scraped individually, and the following elements were extracted whenever available:
          media name, article title, article URL, publication date and time, excerpt, and associated image. The scraping
          process was designed to preserve the original formatting of titles and texts as closely as possible, including
          capitalization and punctuation, as these details later proved crucial for identifying exact textual
          repetitions.

        </p>

        <!-- Section 3 -->
        <h2>Analysis</h2>

        <p>
          The data collection process resulted in a dataset of more than 43,507 entries, each corresponding to a single
          published article. The core analysis focused on identifying exact textual repetitions across different media
          outlets. Articles were systematically compared to detect cases in which identical titles appeared in at least
          two distinct sources within the 13-site corpus. At this stage, only exact matches were retained;
          near-duplicates, paraphrases, and partially edited versions were deliberately excluded in order to isolate the
          most explicit form of replication.

        </p>
        <figure class="blog-image">
          <img src="images_protocol/dataset.png" alt="Dataset from the collected articles">

        </figure>
        <p>
          Applying these replication criteria reduced the dataset to approximately 10% of the original articles. This
          subset is interpreted as indicative of paid or coordinated content, where repetition is not incidental but
          structural. In this context, replication functions less as citation and more as a mechanism of synchronized
          distribution.

        </p>

        <!-- Section 4 -->
        <h2>Findings</h2>

        <p>
          This analysis does not seek to determine the origin of information, but rather to observe its behavior once
          released into a saturated media environment. By reconstructing the replication anatomy of repeated articles,
          news content is approached not as narrative but as organism: mutating minimally, spreading efficiently, and
          optimizing for visibility rather than truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Replication anatomy is understood here as the temporal and spatial structure through which an article
          reproduces across media outlets. It is measured from the moment of first appearance and expressed through
          patterns of clustered simultaneity, compressed propagation, and delayed reactivation.

        </p>
        <figure class="blog-image">
          <img src="images_protocol/results.png" alt="Results">
          <figcaption>
            Results about the replication frequency. 
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The most striking finding concerns the immediacy of replication. The minimum replication time across the
          dataset is zero minutes. Both the first quartile and the median are also zero, meaning that at least 50% of
          all reposts occur within the exact same minute as the article’s first appearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such simultaneity strongly suggests that replication is not driven by organic discovery or audience
          engagement. Instead, it points to pre-prepared content, syndication mechanisms, immediate copying upon
          publication, or the use of shared backends, content management systems, or feeds. In this context, replication
          appears less as response and more as execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond instantaneous reposting, replication remains tightly compressed in time. Approximately 75% of all
          reposts occur within 3.4 minutes of the initial publication. This narrow temporal window leaves little room
          for interpretation as organic sharing or editorial decision-making.

        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than persuasion unfolding over time, the data indicates pressure: a coordinated burst designed to
          saturate the media space as quickly as possible. Visibility is achieved not through accumulation, but through
          simultaneity. The spectacle, as described in the accompanying poetic framework, arrives first as noise.

        </p>
        <figure class="blog-image">
          <img src="images_protocol/replication_anatomy.png" alt="Replication anatomy">
          <figcaption>
            This is the process of replication of one article. 
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Taken together, these findings support the interpretation of replication as structural rather than incidental.
          The absence of an incubation phase, the immediacy of reproduction, the minimal mutation of titles and images,
          and the presence of rare but extended latency all align with the metaphor of viral behavior.

        </p>
        <p>
          In this framework, news circulation resembles content deployment rather than journalistic exchange. The
          spectacle does not persuade through argument, but conditions through repetition. It arrives first as noise,
          then as narrative, and finally as habit.
